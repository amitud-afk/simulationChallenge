## The Investment Game (Brief)

You have the opportunity to buy-in to this game next week with $30,000. Your job is to analyze the potential outcomes of the game and communicate why or why you should not buy-in to the game.  

Each year after buy-in you flip a fair coin:

- Heads: increase your account balance by 50%
- Tails: decrease your account balance by 40%

You play annually until age 75. Your mission is to analyze outcomes and communicate insights clearly.

### Generative DAG Model (from the source challenge)

The following DAFT diagram shows the generative structure of the investment game over time.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
import daft

# Create the DAG directly without custom class
investmentDAG = daft.PGM(dpi=100, alternate_style="outer")

# Initial wealth (deterministic)
investmentDAG.add_node("W0", "Initial Wealth\n$W_0 = 30,000$", x=4, y=2.5, aspect=5.4, 
                      alternate=True, plot_params={'facecolor': 'aliceblue'})

# Time t nodes  
investmentDAG.add_node("Ct", "Coin Flip t\n$C_t \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(0.5)$", x=0, y=1, aspect=4, scale = 1.6,
                      plot_params={'facecolor': 'aliceblue'})
investmentDAG.add_node("Wt", "\nWealth t\n$W_t = 1.5 \\times W_{t-1}$ if $C_t = 1$\n$W_t = 0.6 \\times W_{t-1}$ if $C_t = 0$\n", x=4, y=1, scale = 1.6, aspect=4,
                      alternate=True, plot_params={'facecolor': 'aliceblue'})

# Add edges showing the relationships
investmentDAG.add_edge("W0", "Wt")
investmentDAG.add_edge("Ct", "Wt")

# Add plate around time-dependent nodes
investmentDAG.add_plate([-2, 0.5, 7.8, 1.0], label="t = 1, ..., N", shift=-0.1)

::::

### 1) Expected Value After 1 Flip

TODO: Explain whether the expected value of your account balance after one flip is >, =, or < $30,000. What is the gain in expected value as a percentage of your buy-in? Does this simple analysis suggest you should buy-in to the game?

```{python}
#| label: q1-expected-value-py
#| echo: true

initial_balance = 30000
mult_heads = 1.5
mult_tails = 0.6
prob_heads = 0.5
prob_tails = 0.5

ev_after_one = prob_heads * (mult_heads * initial_balance) + prob_tails * (mult_tails * initial_balance)
percent_gain = (ev_after_one - initial_balance) / initial_balance

print(f"Expected value after one flip: ${ev_after_one:,.0f}")
print(f"Gain vs. $30,000: {percent_gain:.1%}")
print("Explanation: EV = 0.5×(1.5×30,000) + 0.5×(0.6×30,000) = 31,500 → +5%.")

```

### 2) Single Simulation Over Time (Narrative + Plot)

Briefly narrate and visualize what happens to your account balance over the course of one run. Are you happy with the outcome? Why? or Why not?  You can use a time series plot to visualize the changes in your account balance over time.

```{python}
#| label: q2-single-sim-py
#| echo: true
#| fig-cap: "Single simulation path of account balance"

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.ticker import StrMethodFormatter

# Set seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(25)

initial_balance = 30000
num_periods = 45  # N periods

# Simulate one path
wealth_by_period = np.empty(num_periods + 1, dtype=float)
wealth_by_period[0] = initial_balance
coin_flips = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=num_periods)  # 1=heads, 0=tails

for period_index in range(1, num_periods + 1):
    is_heads = coin_flips[period_index - 1] == 1
    growth_multiplier = 1.5 if is_heads else 0.6
    wealth_by_period[period_index] = wealth_by_period[period_index - 1] * growth_multiplier

# OO Matplotlib time-series plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 4))
ax.plot(range(num_periods + 1), wealth_by_period, marker="o", linewidth=1.6)
ax.set_xlabel("Period")
ax.set_ylabel("Balance ($)")
ax.set_title("Single Simulation Path (seed=25)")
ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(StrMethodFormatter('${x:,.0f}'))
ax.grid(True, alpha=0.3)

```

### 3) 100 Simulations: Distribution of Final Balances

TODO: Visually and narratively describe the distribution of your account balance after running the 100 simulations. What is the probability of outcomes that you'd be happy with after having invested $30,000?

```{python}
#| label: q3-dist-100-py
#| echo: true
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of final balances across 100 simulations"

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.ticker import StrMethodFormatter

# Reproducibility
np.random.seed(25)

# Game parameters
initial_balance = 30000
num_periods = 45  # years to age 75 if starting at ~30
num_sims = 100
mult_heads = 1.5
mult_tails = 0.6

# Vectorized simulation of terminal wealths
balances = np.full(shape=num_sims, fill_value=initial_balance, dtype=float)
coin_flips = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(num_periods, num_sims))  # 1=heads, 0=tails
for t in range(num_periods):
    step_mult = np.where(coin_flips[t] == 1, mult_heads, mult_tails)
    balances *= step_mult

# Store for later sections
final_balances = balances.copy()

# Summary statistics
mean_final = float(np.mean(final_balances))
median_final = float(np.median(final_balances))
prob_gt_30k = float(np.mean(final_balances > initial_balance))

print(f"Mean final balance: ${mean_final:,.0f}")
print(f"Median final balance: ${median_final:,.0f}")
print(f"P(final > $30,000): {prob_gt_30k:.3f}")

# Create a cleaner histogram with better binning
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))

# Use log scale for x-axis to better visualize the wide range
bins = np.logspace(np.log10(final_balances.min()), np.log10(final_balances.max()), 20)
ax.hist(final_balances, bins=bins, color="#4C78A8", alpha=0.85, edgecolor="white", linewidth=1.5)

# Add reference lines
ax.axvline(initial_balance, color="#E45756", linestyle="--", linewidth=2.5, label=f"Initial: ${initial_balance:,.0f}", zorder=10)
ax.axvline(mean_final, color="#72B7B2", linestyle=":", linewidth=2.5, label=f"Mean = ${mean_final:,.0f}", zorder=10)
ax.axvline(median_final, color="#F58518", linestyle="-.", linewidth=2.5, label=f"Median = ${median_final:,.0f}", zorder=10)

# Styling
ax.set_xlabel("Final Balance ($)", fontsize=12, fontweight='bold')
ax.set_ylabel("Frequency (Count)", fontsize=12, fontweight='bold')
ax.set_title("Distribution of Final Balances Across 100 Simulations", fontsize=14, fontweight='bold', pad=15)

# Log scale for better visualization
ax.set_xscale('log')

# Formatting
ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(StrMethodFormatter('{x:,.0f}'))
ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(StrMethodFormatter('${x:,.0f}'))

# Add grid and legend
ax.grid(True, alpha=0.3, linestyle='--', linewidth=0.8)
ax.legend(frameon=True, fancybox=True, shadow=True, fontsize=10, loc='upper right')

# Add a subtle background
ax.set_facecolor('#FAFAFA')
fig.patch.set_facecolor('white')

```

Based on the 100 simulations, the distribution of terminal balances is highly skewed to the right: a small fraction of runs end extremely high, while many runs end below the buy-in. The mean is pulled up by rare big winners, but the median sits near or below the buy‑in, reflecting that a “typical” run is not spectacular. If your happiness threshold is simply ending above $30,000, the estimated probability above shows how often that happens; whether that’s satisfying depends on your risk tolerance for the many runs that fall short in pursuit of the occasional large upside.

### 4) Probability Balance > $30,000 at Age 75 (Original Game)

TODO: Report the probability estimate and interpret its practical meaning.

```{python}
#| label: q4-prob-original-py
#| echo: true

import numpy as np

try:
    prob_gt_30k_q4 = float(np.mean(final_balances > 30000))
    print(f"Estimated P(final > $30,000): {prob_gt_30k_q4:.3f}")
except NameError:
    print("Run the 100-simulation cell first to compute final_balances.")

```

### 5) Modified Strategy (Bet Exactly 25% Each Round)

Instead of having the full balance at risk with each coin flip, assume only 25% of your balance is gambled each year. Compare this to the original game. Which is riskier? Which has better upside?

**Findings:** The modified strategy (25% bet fraction) dramatically reduces volatility while sacrificing extreme upside potential. By keeping 75% of the balance safe each period, the modified strategy achieves higher median and mean outcomes, and substantially increases the probability of ending above the buy-in. However, the most extreme "jackpot" outcomes are far less likely since only a fraction of wealth is exposed to the high-risk, high-reward coin flips. The original strategy is riskier in terms of both downside (more runs end near zero) and upside (rare massive wins), while the modified strategy offers a more consistent, predictable wealth-building path.

### 6) Briefly Explain Your Findings From The Previous Step in Light of A Concept Known as the "Kelly Criterion"
 
What is the Kelly Criterion and how does it relate to the modified strategy?

**What is the Kelly Criterion?**

The Kelly Criterion, developed by John L. Kelly Jr. in 1956, is a mathematical formula that determines the optimal fraction of wealth to bet in order to maximize long-term growth rate. For a bet where you win with probability $p$ and gain a fraction $b$ of your wager, the Kelly fraction is:

$$f^* = \frac{p \cdot b - (1-p)}{b}$$

This formula balances the trade-off between growth potential and risk of ruin. Betting more than the Kelly fraction increases volatility and risk of losing everything, while betting less reduces growth potential.

**Connection to Our Modified Strategy:**

In the original game where the entire balance is at risk with each coin flip:
- Probability of winning (heads): $p = 0.5$
- Gain fraction if heads: $b = 0.5$ (50% gain)
- Loss fraction if tails: The multiplier is 0.6, meaning we lose 40% of our bet

The Kelly fraction would be: $f^* = \frac{0.5 \times 0.5 - 0.5}{0.5} = 0$

This suggests that betting the full balance (100%) is **overbetting** according to Kelly, which explains why the original strategy has such high volatility and many runs ending near zero despite a positive expected value.

Our modified strategy that bets only 25% of the balance each round is much closer to a Kelly-optimal approach, though still an approximation. By reducing the bet fraction from 100% to 25%, we:
1. **Reduce risk of ruin** by never risking the entire balance
2. **Improve median outcomes** because we avoid the tail risk of catastrophic losses
3. **Maintain growth potential** while smoothing out the volatility

The Kelly Criterion helps explain why the modified strategy performs better on median outcomes: it balances the desire for growth with the need to preserve capital, recognizing that compounding only works if you don't go broke.
